  <p style="margin-top: 350px; position: absolute; center: 100%; color: white; left: 611px; top: 316px;"> It’s my pleasure to welcome you to our website and I am sure you would want to browse through some of the sections, just to get to know and have a feel of what we offer. We are the Destiny Church (Birmingham Branch in the UK), a people of Destiny with our feet and heart solidly anchored in the living word of God and our sublimed faith rooted in our Triumphant Saviour – the Lord Jesus Christ. The fact that you’ve logged-on to this site convinces me that you are an individual seeking and yearning after God’s heart and God’s solution to your needs. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 600px; position: absolute; center: 100%; color: white; right: 36px; top: 318px; width: 880px; height: 16px;"> Many are at their wits end today, totally oblivious of their purpose in life – even after the “New Birth”. Confusion lingers in many hearts - on how best to function in the body of Christ. Many do not even understand their callings and how best to position themselves in their Ministries. They are un-established; as they are perennially wandering in a maze of “uncertainties”, searching for what to do and how to execute the Lord’s mandate. That is where we come in as a Ministry to enable you end this search. We are here to “open you up” to God’s intentions and purposes for your life and your Ministry. You can find satisfaction in whatever the Lord is calling you into. The Lord may have called you to be an intercessor in your local church, it could be to support and strengthen the leadership in a range of ways, it might be to tidy up the place of worship, ushering, etc. In whatever capacity you have been called to function, you can reach your maximum potential, and you can do so with the knowledge and satisfaction that - you are operating at the very centre of God’s eternal purpose for your life. As a matter of fact, we would like to help, support and contribute to your fulfilment and satisfaction in the vineyard of the Lord. We want to see you fully established in your Ministry – thus ending the cycles of frustration, largely occasioned from not knowing what to do. In a nutshell, in Destiny Church, we Establish Ministries. </p>

But you don’t have to remain that way. You are ordained to experience a newness of life, filled with joy and triumph. Christ both destroyed and removed the yoke of curse from off our necks. You can walk free. You can come out of defeats. You can have the abundant, fabulous life in Christ which you have always desired and rightly deserve. Do you see or feel yourself tied up? Are you wallowing in re-occurring defeats and failures? Are you helpless and at the verge of hopelessness? Are you bogged down with heaviness, sickness, lack, worries and anxiety? Here in Destiny Church, we will simply show you the way out. </p>
